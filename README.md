**Moozik** is a project that creates a Spotify playlist for a roadtrip based on the roadtrip's
estimated travel time.

Uses the Google Maps API to calculate estimated travel time for the user's trip. The application
then uses the Spotify to create the playlist based on the calculated travel time and the user's
genre preferences based on Spotify.
